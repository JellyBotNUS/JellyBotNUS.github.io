    <h2>1. Concept Generation</h2>
    <p>
        In the early stages of the project, inspiration was drawn from prior research on jellyfish-inspired soft robotic systems. Two notable studies—the Untethered Robot Jellyfish (New Atlas, 2019) and Jellyfish-Inspired Soft Robot Driven by Pneumatic Bistable Actuators (Wang et al., 2020)—provided valuable insights into achieving jellyfish-like propulsion through soft-bodied and pneumatic actuation mechanisms.
        
        From studying these examples, several important design insights were gained. Most jellyfish-inspired robots share a dome-shaped upper body coupled with a cylindrical housing that contains the electronic, power, and control systems. This configuration offers a good balance between biological resemblance, hydrodynamic efficiency, and practical integration. While structural designs remain relatively consistent, propulsion methods vary significantly—ranging from mechanical linkages and flapping fins to pneumatic or hybrid actuation systems, each with distinct trade-offs in autonomy, control, and biomimicry.
        
        Recognizing these design patterns, our team adopted the proven dome-and-cylinder structure to ensure both stability and efficiency in water. Building on this foundation, the next stage of the design process focused on evaluating different propulsion concepts—such as thrusters, mechanical fins, and pneumatic silicone actuators—to identify the most feasible and ecologically compatible solution for JellyBot.
    </p>
    <section id="section-2">
    <h2>2. Concept Selection </h2>
    <p>
      In the development of our jellyfish-inspired soft robotic prototype, three propulsion concepts were evaluated: (A) thruster propellers, (B) mechanical linkages with fins, and (C) pneumatic silicone actuation. All concepts shared a similar structural design consisting of a cylindrical housing to contain the electronics and a dome enclosure for the camera, but differed primarily in their propulsion mechanisms.
    <p>
      <strong>Concept A: Thrusters/Propellers</strong><p>
      Standard underwater propulsion using propellers. This method is simple, widely proven, and provides strong thrust. However, it is noisy and potentially disruptive to sensitive marine ecosystems, reducing its suitability for ecological monitoring.
    <p>
      <strong>Concept B: Mechanical Linkages with Fins</strong><p>
      Actuation achieved through mechanical linkages driving rigid or semi-rigid fins. This approach provides directional control and higher maneuverability compared to passive soft structures. However, it introduces added complexity in waterproofing moving joints, as well as potential mechanical wear and friction issues.
    <p>
      <strong>Concept C: Pneumatic Silicone Actuators</strong><p>
      Soft silicone tentacles actuated by pressurized air to generate pulsatile movement similar to natural jellyfish propulsion. This method is highly biomimetic, energy-efficient in low-speed cruising, and safe for marine life due to its soft interaction with the environment. It also offers quieter operation, making it more eco-friendly for coral reef monitoring.

      </div>
    <p>  
      <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong><p>
      The following six criteria were selected to reflect project objectives and practical constraints:
     <p> 
      Biomimicry (25%) – how closely the propulsion resembles jellyfish swimming.
      Manufacturability (20%) – ease of prototyping and fabrication.
      Energy Efficiency (15%) – power consumption relative to endurance goals.
      Eco-friendliness (15%) – impact on marine ecosystems (noise, turbulence, safety).
      Control Complexity (10%) – difficulty of implementation and actuation.
      Cost Savings (10%) – estimated material and production cost.
    <p>
      Weights were applied to prioritize biomimicry and eco-friendliness, as the project’s primary goal is to develop a reef-compatible and environmentally safe surveillance platform. At the same time, manufacturability was given significant consideration to ensure the concept can be realistically prototyped and refined within the constraints of available resources, fabrication tools, and materials. By balancing innovation with practicality, the design process ensures that JellyBot remains not only functionally effective but also feasible to produce and scale for research applications. Table 1 summarizes the comparative assessment.

<p>
    (<strong>Pneumatic Silicone Actuation</strong>) was identified as the most suitable approach, achieving the highest weighted score of 4.20. This concept demonstrates the best overall balance across biomimicry, manufacturability, energy efficiency, and eco-friendliness, making it ideal for replicating natural jellyfish propulsion in a sustainable and cost-effective manner. While the control system and fabrication process may require moderate refinement, these challenges are outweighed by its superior biomimetic performance and low environmental impact. Additionally, the silicone-based pneumatic actuation offers excellent energy efficiency and significant cost savings compared to traditional propulsion methods, ensuring that JellyBot remains both economically viable and environmentally safe for prolonged reef monitoring operations.

    <h2>3. Housing Material Selection</h2>
    <p>
     For the first prototype of the jellyfish-inspired soft robot, the primary goal was to test the feasibility of the concept — specifically, to validate the movement, waterproofing, and integration of the pneumatic system. As such, the housing material selection focused on cost-effective, readily available, and easy-to-fabricate materials rather than final production-grade components.
      <p>
      <strong>Material Options Considered</strong><p>
      <strong>Acrylic:</strong>
      Acrylic was initially considered due to its optical clarity, making it suitable for viewing internal components and housing the camera system. However, it is brittle under stress and susceptible to cracking during drilling or assembly. Its bonding process requires solvent welding, which can degrade over time under constant water exposure.
      <p>
      <strong>Aluminum Alloy:</strong>
      Aluminum was evaluated for its rigidity and strength, but its higher weight and need for anti-corrosion treatment made it less suitable for early prototyping. Additionally, machining aluminum components increases fabrication time and cost.
      <p>

      <strong>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC):</strong>
      PVC was ultimately selected for the first prototype due to its low cost, ease of assembly, and excellent waterproofing characteristics. Readily available PVC pipes and fittings allowed for rapid fabrication without specialized equipment. The material is lightweight, chemically resistant, and compatible with silicone sealants and O-rings, enabling secure and watertight joints. Moreover, the cylindrical shape of standard PVC pipes aligned well with the desired jellyfish-inspired form, simplifying integration with the dome enclosure and internal pneumatic components.
      <p>
      <strong>Final Selection</strong><p>
      For the Prototype 1 housing, PVC was chosen as the primary material as it offered the best balance between practicality, cost, and functionality. Using PVC allowed the team to focus on testing the robot’s propulsion and waterproof performance without the constraints of expensive fabrication. Its modular nature also supports easy disassembly and modification, which is essential for iterative prototyping.

    </p>
    <section id="section-4">
    <h2>4. Designing of Prototype 1</h2>
    <p>
    The initial design of Prototype 1 was developed with the goal of creating a jellyfish-inspired soft robot (Jellybot) capable of underwater propulsion and environmental observation. The concept draws inspiration from the natural locomotion of jellyfish, which move by contracting and relaxing their bell to generate thrust. The robot’s propulsion system is powered by pneumatic silicone tentacles, enabling a soft, pulsating motion that closely mimics biological jellyfish swimming for efficient and eco-friendly movement underwater.
    <p>
    <strong>Housing and Structural Design</strong><p>
    
    For the first prototype, the body structure was fabricated using PVC pipe rather than 3D-printed materials. Earlier trials with 3D-printed parts revealed persistent leakage issues at layer boundaries, which compromised waterproofing and structural reliability. PVC was therefore selected for its superior watertight integrity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of modification. The cylindrical PVC housing provides a robust enclosure for internal electronics, including the pneumatic system, battery, and control circuits. Its smooth interior also facilitates sealing with silicone and O-rings, ensuring the protection of electronic components during submersion.
    <p>
    A clear acrylic dome was mounted on the top section to house the onboard camera, offering an unobstructed field of view for potential surveillance and coral monitoring applications. The modular design of the housing enables straightforward assembly, maintenance, and replacement of components, which is essential for iterative testing.
    <img src="https://github.com/JellyBotNUS/JellyBotNUS.github.io/blob/main/images/conceptselection.png?raw=true" alt="Concept Selection">
    </div>

    <strong>Tentacle and Flap Design</strong><p>
    
    The propulsion system employs eight pneumatic silicone tentacles attached symmetrically around the lower base of the PVC housing. Each tentacle is fabricated using a custom-designed mold based on proven research approaches (Wang et al., 2020; FludoJelly, 2019), featuring internal chambers that expand under air pressure to simulate the contraction of jellyfish arms.
    <p>
    To unify these tentacles into a coordinated propulsion unit, a flexible silicone flap was cast around their base. This flap acts as a bell-like membrane, connecting all tentacles while maintaining flexibility. During inflation, the tentacles expand outward, and the flap deforms slightly to push water downward, generating upward thrust. The flap was produced by pouring Ecoflex 30 silicone—chosen for its flexibility and durability—between the spaces of the tentacles up to a 2 mm thickness. Unlike the tentacles, the flap does not transmit air pressure directly; rather, it enhances fluid displacement and smoothens the pulsation motion during actuation.
