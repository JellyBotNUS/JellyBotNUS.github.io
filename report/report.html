      <h2>1. Background</h2>
      <p><strong>Importance of coral reefs:</strong> Coral reefs are the most species-rich ecosystems in the ocean. Although they occur across more than one hundred countries and occupy well under 1% of the seafloor, their intricate, three-dimensional frameworks provide habitat, nursery grounds, and feeding areas for roughly a quarter of described marine species. 
      This biological richness translates into substantial human benefits: reef fisheries and tourism support livelihoods, reef crests dissipate wave energy and reduce flooding, and bioprospecting has yielded medically relevant compounds. 
      Recent global assessments estimate the combined value of these services at around US$2.7 trillion per year (GCRMN, 2020). </p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="Figure 1">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 1</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Status and pressures:</strong> Reefs are also among the ecosystems most exposed to human pressures. The IPCC (2019) identifies coral reefs as the marine system at highest risk from climate change—particularly marine heatwaves and stronger storms—compounded by ocean acidification. 
      Local stressors exacerbate these impacts: nutrient and sediment runoff, marine pollution, and overfishing (including destructive methods) all erode reef condition and resilience.</p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="Figure 2">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 2</p>
      </div>
      <p>As coral cover drops and structural complexity flattens, competitive balance shifts toward fleshy algae, especially where herbivory is depleted or water quality is poor; global datasets show algal cover increasing over the same period. </p>
      <div class="center-image">
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="Figure 3">
        <p class="figure-caption">Figure 3</p>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Coral reefs lie at the intersection of today’s three interconnected environmental crises: biodiversity loss, climate change, and pollution. 
      Even if global warming is limited to 1.5 °C, prolonged heat stress is projected to put the vast majority of reefs at risk by mid-century. 
      The consequences extend beyond species loss: hundreds of millions of people—especially in least-developed countries, economies in transition, and small island developing states—depend on reefs for food security, income, cultural identity, and coastal safety. 
      Safeguarding live coral cover and preserving the structural complexity of reefs is therefore both an ecological and a human development priority..</p>

        <p>Our jellyfish-inspired underwater robot helps marine researchers and ecologists who want to observe and capture data on marine life 
          in fragile ecosystems by providing compact, silent, and biomimetic propulsion and minimizing disturbance to natural behavior.

    <section id="section-3">
      <h2>3. Problem Clarification</h2>
      <p><strong>Problem Clarification:</strong> Underwater ecosystems such as coral reefs are highly fragile and easily disturbed by conventional exploration methods. Traditional approaches involving divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) face several limitations that compromise both cost-efficiency and ecological safety. 
        Bulky ROVs struggle with maneuverability in narrow reef passages and shallow coastal zones, while propeller-driven systems generate noise and turbulence that can damage delicate coral structures. Diver-based surveys, on the other hand, demand extensive logistical support—trained personnel, safety teams, oxygen supplies, and large research vessels—resulting in high operational costs and time constraints, often amounting to hundreds to thousands of dollars per mission. 
        Moreover, diver interactions pose direct risks to coral health;studies have shown that 94% of divers make contact with reef substrates, averaging 16 contacts every 10 minutes, with 66% causing visible coral damage (Worachananant et al., 2008). These findings highlight the need for an alternative exploration method that is compact, quiet, energy-efficient, and minimally invasive. Inspired by the gentle propulsion of jellyfish, 
        biomimetic robots like JellyBot offer a promising solution—utilizing soft, pulsatile locomotion that mimics natural movement to enable low-energy, silent, and ecologically responsible underwater exploration without disrupting fragile marine ecosystems.</p>
      <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Traditional underwater exploration methods—such as human divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)—often disturb delicate marine ecosystems and are constrained by size, noise, and maneuverability limitations. Divers and ROVs can unintentionally damage fragile coral structures through turbulence or direct contact, 
        while diver-based surveys remain costly, manpower-intensive, and limited by dive duration and safety constraints. These challenges highlight the need for a compact, silent, and biomimetic underwater robot capable of navigating complex reef structures 
        and shallow coastal environments to capture ecological data without disrupting marine life. The JellyBot aims to address this issue by mimicking the gentle, pulsatile propulsion of jellyfish, enabling precise, energy-efficient, 
        and unobtrusive exploration that supports ecological research and long-term conservation efforts in a sustainable and responsible manner.</p>
      <p><strong>How Might We Framework:</strong> To reframe the design challenge into actionable opportunities, the How Might We (HMW) framework was applied to guide the ideation process and ensure alignment between technological innovation and ecological responsibility. 
        Key guiding questions include: How might we create an underwater robot that moves quietly and naturally to avoid disturbing marine life?; How might we design a compact system capable of navigating confined and shallow reef environments?; 
        and How might we apply biomimicry to achieve efficient propulsion with minimal energy consumption? Additional questions explore how we might enable long-duration ecological monitoring without human intervention, 
        how we might ensure high-quality data and footage capture while remaining unobtrusive, and how we might develop a cost-efficient solution that reduces reliance on expensive diver or ROV operations. 
        By structuring the challenge through these questions, the project team can focus on developing innovative, sustainable, and affordable solutions that not only address technical feasibility but also advance marine research and conservation goals in an ecologically responsible manner.</p>

		<p><strong>Interpretation of Cost and Method Comparison</strong></p>
		<p style="margin-bottom:40px;">The cost and method comparison show that JellyBot is a far more affordable and sustainable solution for coral reef monitoring in Singapore compared to traditional diver surveys and commercial ROVs. Diver-based methods cost around SGD 35,000 annually due to frequent boat rentals, manpower, and equipment, while ROVs, though safer and capable of deeper dives, require a high initial investment of SGD 20,000–60,000 and constant operator supervision. In contrast, JellyBot offers a low-cost alternative at about SGD 1,000, operating autonomously in shallow reefs with minimal environmental impact. Its soft propulsion and long-term deployment potential make it ideal for frequent, low-maintenance reef monitoring, reducing both human involvement and operational costs while enhancing ecological safety.</p>
